The main idea of `Jails` is to focus on simplicity, pushing away complexity to external packages.
That is why it can be used with **any other library**. It can be used with `jQuery` and it will be compatible with any jQuery plugins or any other javascript vanilla modules which is already been written by community.

Jails do not intend to own every single part of your application by forcing you to load jails modules to address issues of some part of your application. All those modules and solutions are out there to be used or to be discovered.

`Jails-org` is a place used to centralize all good solutions out there for any kind of needs.
Also, it has repositories for Demos, Screencasts etc..
